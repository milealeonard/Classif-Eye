Classif-Eye is a semi-automated application to allows the user to rapidly assess and classify/grade images for research purposes. 
The application also provides the output of the classification in a CSV file and is particularly useful for machine leaning and supervised deep learning studies where:
     - a reference standard is required for training the system;
     - the grading performance is compared between multiple graders.
